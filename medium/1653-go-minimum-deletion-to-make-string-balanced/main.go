// rip me ;-;
// after long night i think i knew why requirement gathering is so muuuuuch IMPORTANT
// waste of my 3-4 hours of solving another problem T T

// the prob desc:
// "pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'."  <-- da h lol

// someone in discuss just say:
// "it's basically saying that no 'b' can come before any 'a'"
// "The use of "pair" in the description is overly complicated"

// the wording 'balance' make me confused so much ._.
// anyway i would do this prob later. soon.
